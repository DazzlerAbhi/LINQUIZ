# LINQUIZ - CLI-Based Quiz Application

## üìö Description

In traditional quiz or test systems, manual operations such as paper preparation, question randomization, evaluation, and result tabulation are 
time-consuming and error-prone. There's also a lack of personalization and instant feedback, which are essential in modern learning systems.

So the question arises - **"How can we create an efficient, reusable, and scalable quiz system using C++ that supports multiple user roles, 
offers secure and personalized interaction, and maintains quiz data persistently using a database?"** 

This quiz system provides a solution to the above problem. It solves :
‚óè The inefficiency of manual quiz management.
‚óè Lack of real-time evaluation and scoring. 
‚óè Absence of centralized records for tracking user performance over time.

**LINQUIZ** is a command-line quiz application built using **C++** with **MySQL integration**, applying Object-Oriented Programming principles. 
This group project was developed using **Dev-C++**, and supports both **Admin** and **Student** roles, enabling dynamic quiz creation, scoring, and persistent data storage.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **C++ (with STL)**  
- **Dev-C++ IDE**  
- **MySQL**  
- **MySQL C++ Connector**  

---

## üöÄ Getting Started

### üìå Prerequisites

- Dev-C++ (5.11 or later)  
- MySQL Server & MySQL C++ Connector  
- MySQL DB with relevant tables created (manually or from `schema.sql`)  

---

## üñ•Ô∏è Setting Up the Project in Dev-C++

1. **Open Dev-C++**  
2. Go to `File` > `Open Project`  
3. Select `OOPS _Proj.dev` file  
4. Ensure you have added MySQL Connector libraries:  
   - Go to `Project` > `Project Options` > `Parameters` tab  
   - Under `Linker`, add:
     ```
     -lmysql
     -lmysqlcppconn
     ```

5. **Update Database Credentials** in `main.cpp`:
   ```cpp
   const char* host = "localhost";
   const char* user = "root";
   const char* password = "your_password";
   const char* database = "linquiz_db";
   ```

6. **Compile & Run** the project.
